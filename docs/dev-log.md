# Development Log

## September 9, 2026

An audit of the repo against its own documentation turned up nine places where
the docs described something the code did not do. Fixed all of them, and added
the test suite that would have caught most of them.

### Corrections to the June 17 entry below
- **"LangGraph streaming required wrapping `astream_events` rather than
  `astream`"** — this was never true of this codebase. Neither call appears
  anywhere in it; `main.py` used (and still uses) the synchronous
  `compiled_graph.stream(stream_mode="updates")`. What streamed was per-agent
  log entries, not tokens.
- **"CORS needed explicit origin allowlist for Vercel preview URLs"** — no
  Vercel origin was ever added. `allow_origins` was hardcoded to localhost, so
  a deployed frontend would have been blocked.

### Fixed
- **Docker networking.** Commit `3ba4d2e` had changed `VITE_API_URL` from
  `http://localhost:8000` to `http://backend:8000` as a "fix". That value is
  inlined into the browser bundle, and `backend` only resolves inside the
  compose network — so the documented `docker-compose up` flow failed on its
  first API call. Reverted, with a comment explaining why.
- **CORS is configuration now.** `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` plus an optional
  `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN_REGEX` for preview deployments, surfaced in `render.yaml`
  and `.env.example`.
- **Token streaming is real.** The Writer now uses `client.messages.stream()`
  and emits each chunk as a `report_token` SSE event; the frontend renders the
  report progressively instead of waiting for the run to finish. Nodes reach
  the session queue through a ContextVar emitter (`backend/events.py`) rather
  than threading a callback through every signature.
- **The refine loop ADR-001 described now exists.** A new `refiner` node
  rewrites sub-questions that found nothing, and `route_after_research` loops
  back for another pass when coverage is thin and budget remains.
- **Search failures are no longer silent.** `search_web` retries with backoff
  and raises `SearchError` instead of returning `[]`; the Researcher keeps
  "ran and found nothing" separate from "could not run", and errors the run if
  every search failed. The Analyst refuses to synthesize from zero sources.
- **Dead dependency removed.** `langchain` and `langchain-anthropic` were
  pinned but never imported — the agents use the Anthropic SDK directly. The
  model ID moved to `config.ANTHROPIC_MODEL` and the client to `llm.py`, so
  it is no longer repeated in each agent.
- **Images run production servers.** The backend Dockerfile no longer passes
  `--reload` (compose overrides the command for local dev); the frontend
  Dockerfile is multi-stage, serving built assets from nginx, with a `dev`
  target for compose.
- **Session leak closed.** Sessions carry a `created_at`; a background sweeper
  drops ones whose client never connected, and `MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS` returns
  429 rather than letting the queue dict grow unbounded. The single-worker
  requirement is now written down (ADR-005) instead of implied.
- **Plan reconciled with reality.** Milestones ticked, and the unmeasured
  "under 30 seconds" success criterion replaced with the timeout the code
  actually enforces.

### Verified
- 37 backend tests pass (`pytest` in `backend/`), including an integration test
  that drives the real compiled graph through planner → researcher → refiner →
  researcher → analyst → writer and asserts the retry loop both fires and
  terminates.
- `npm run build` produces a clean production bundle (288 modules).
- Not verified: a live end-to-end run against the real Anthropic and Tavily
  APIs. That needs credentials this audit did not have, so every test fakes the
  two external clients.

### Verified against the live APIs
Two full runs with real keys, via `scripts/live_smoke.py`:

| | run 1 | run 2 |
|---|---|---|
| query | health effects of sleep deprivation | causes of the 2008 financial crisis |
| total | 100.4s | 108.2s |
| first report token | 40.1s | 40.7s |
| report | 15,020 chars, 97 chunks | 15,514 chars, 111 chunks |
| sources | 15 | 15 |

Both produced structured reports with inline citations and a Limitations
section, and all eight checks passed. Streamed chunks reassembled byte for byte
into the final report.

### Found and fixed during that run
The agent timeline was not actually live. `compiled_graph.stream()` only yields
when a node returns, so the Researcher's five searches — about 15 seconds of
work — all appeared at once with the same timestamp. Progress now goes through
the emitter (`emit_log`) as each step finishes, so the Researcher reports at
7.2s, 10.6s, 12.7s, 16.2s and 18.6s rather than in one burst. `main.py` no
longer diffs the log list; the emitter is the only path for `agent_update`.

### Analyst streaming
The 40-second wait before anything appeared was the worst part of a run: the
Planner, five searches and the Analyst all completed before the Writer produced
the first visible token. The Analyst now streams too, into a collapsible panel
that folds away once the report starts.

Measured on a live run ("How does CRISPR gene editing actually work?"):

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| first visible output | 40.1s | 15.8s |
| first report token | 40.1s | 37.4s |
| total | 100.4s | 120.4s |

Output is now near-continuous from 4.2s: planner at 4.2s, searches through
13.5s, analysis 15.8s to 35.4s, report from 37.4s. The two remaining gaps are
about two seconds each.

### Docker Compose verified
Previously untested. Brought the stack up with `docker compose up --build` and
checked it end to end:

- both images build; containers healthy on 8000 and 5173
- `/api/health` answers from the host
- the frontend container serves a bundle with `http://localhost:8000` inlined,
  not `backend:8000` — the June 13 "networking fix" had it backwards, since
  Vite bakes the value into browser code where Docker service names do not
  resolve
- CORS allows `http://localhost:5173` and omits the header for other origins
- a full research run through the containers: 92.3s, 11,601-character report,
  15 sources, streamed text matching the final report byte for byte
- driven through the real UI in a browser: pipeline advances, log entries
  arrive as each search finishes, the analysis panel fills then collapses when
  the report starts, and its toggle reopens it

One thing that only showed up in the browser: the analysis panel was rendering
raw Markdown (`##`, `**`) directly above the rendered report. It now goes
through ReactMarkdown like the report does.

### The four standing limitations, closed
All measured against the live APIs through the Docker stack.

**Speed.** Searches ran one at a time with a 0.5s pause between them. They now
run concurrently, bounded by `SEARCH_CONCURRENCY`. Results are still logged in
planned order from the parent thread, because the emitter is a ContextVar and
pool threads start with a fresh context.

| search phase | before | parallel | parallel + cached |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 sub-questions | ~15s | 2.5s | 0.19s |
| whole run | 92-120s | 83.1s | 74.8s |

**One worker.** Session queues moved behind an interface with in-process and
Redis backends (ADR-006). With `REDIS_URL` set the stack runs two uvicorn
workers and a run POSTed to one worker streams correctly from the other.
`/api/health` now reports `multi_worker_safe` so the difference is observable.

**No caching.** Search results are cached for six hours, in Redis when
available and a bounded dict otherwise. Verified by inspecting the keys in
Redis after a run and timing a repeat of the same question.

**No auth or history.** Email and password with Argon2, bearer tokens, runs
saved per user, SQLite by default (ADR-007). Research still works signed out.
Verified end to end through the UI: register, run, saved to history, reopen.

### Found while doing it
- The container would not start: `pydantic[email]` was installed locally but
  never added to `requirements.txt`. Only the Docker build caught it.
- The default `AUTH_SECRET` was 20 characters, under the 32-byte HS256
  minimum, and shipping any default at all means anyone reading this repo can
  forge a token. Startup now warns, and Render generates its own.
- The search cache leaked between tests, since every test used the query "q".
  Test isolation, not a product bug, but it hid three real assertions.

### Screenshots regenerated, and two bugs they exposed
The three screenshots in the README were the originals from June and no longer
matched the app: no analysis panel, no Refiner, no sign-in header. Recaptured
with Playwright against the Docker stack, driving real runs.

Capturing them surfaced two things:

- **The pipeline never showed the Analyst or Writer as active.** `currentAgent`
  only updated when an agent logged, and both log only when they finish, so the
  timeline sat on Researcher while the analysis streamed. `stationStatus` also
  returned "waiting" for any agent with no log entries, which would have hidden
  the active state even after the first fix. Both corrected.
- **Frontend hot reload was silently broken under compose.** Docker Desktop bind
  mounts do not deliver filesystem events, so Vite never saw host edits. Only
  noticed because a fix appeared not to take effect. Polling is now enabled via
  `VITE_USE_POLLING` in the compose file.

### Next
- Stream the Writer's sources as they are collected rather than only at the end
- Rate-limit registration; there is nothing stopping bulk account creation
- Query history panel in the frontend
- Move session state to Redis if this ever needs more than one worker
